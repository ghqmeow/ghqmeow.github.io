## VASP

>The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package, better known as VASP, is a package for performing ab initio quantum mechanical calculations using either Vanderbilt pseudopotentials, or the projector augmented wave method, and a plane wave basis set(from wikipedia).

To begin with, there are some apps and books you might need to know~

## BOOKs
The following two books are the best way to learn VASP~

<Density Functional Theory:A Practical Introduction>by David S. Sholl (Author), Janice A. Steckel 

Everyone should read this. By the book, we can easily understand what DFT is, and how we solve physical or chemistry problems by DFT.

<The VASP Manual - Vaspwiki> https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/The_VASP_Manual
    
At present, the vasp manual has been changed to wike format, which is more convenient and fast to use.

## APPs

VASP is working under Linux, rather than Windows. So it is controled by code!
    
### linux commands 
linux commands might be different under different version(CentOS, Ubuntu...) and different job management system(pbs, slurm...)
    
    Here are some commands under CentOS and pbs:
    showq
