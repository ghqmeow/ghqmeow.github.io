## VASP

>The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package, better known as VASP, is a package for performing ab initio quantum mechanical calculations using either Vanderbilt pseudopotentials, or the projector augmented wave method, and a plane wave basis set(from wikipedia).

To begin with, there are some apps and books you might need to know~

## BOOKs
<Density Functional Theory: A Practical Introduction> by David S. Sholl (Author), Janice A. Steckel 

Everyone should read this. By the book, we can easily understand what DFT is, and how we solve physical or chemistry problems by DFT.

<The VASP Manual - Vaspwiki> https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/The_VASP_Manual
    
At present, the vasp manual has been changed to wike format, which is more convenient and fast to use.

## APPs

All the apps mentioned here are free~     
    
VASP is working under Linux, rather than Windows. So it is controled by code!
    
So, firstly, you need some tools(SSH/ftp) to connect and control your Linux cluster/pc.
    
By 2023.04, my suggestion is to use MobaXterm. Becasue this is an all-in-one app. Everything you nedd is inside.

For transfer data, MobaXterm is also ok. But I prefer WinSCP~
    
### linux commands 
linux commands might be different under different version(CentOS, Ubuntu...) and different job management system(pbs, slurm...)
    
Here are some commands under CentOS and pbs:
    
    showq   to check what jobs are in the cluster.
    
    'qstat'  to check details about jobs.
    
    'pestat'  to check the nodes information.
    
    'qdel 123456'  to kill the job 123456.
    
    'rm abc'  to delect file 'abc'
    
    'rm -rf abc' to delect the folder '/abc'
    
    'qsub pbs' to run the caculation job
    
    'chmod 777 abc' to give the file 'abc' read and write permissions.
    
### VESTA
VESTA is a professional software for crystal structure and electronic structure visualization~
    
VESTA can convert .cif files(for Materials Studio ro something..) into POSCAR!!!  (File-Export data-...)

### Notepad++
    To nodify the INCAR, KPOINTS, POSCAR... files in Windows.
  
### P4Vasp(optional)
    P4Vasp is used to get DOS!

### Jmol(optional)
    Put OUTCAR into Jmol, to visually view every step of the optimization process.
